# AI Metaverse System

A distributed system of specialized AI assistants working together to create, optimize, and maintain code for the AI Metaverse project.

## Overview

The AI Metaverse System consists of multiple AI assistants, each specialized in different aspects of code development and optimization:

- **Earth**: Generates foundational code structures
- **Moon**: Identifies and resolves syntax errors
- **Sun**: Analyzes and optimizes code performance
- (Additional assistants to be implemented)

```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Git (for version control)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/ai-metaverse.git
cd ai-metaverse
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env

# Add the following variables to .env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=cygel.co
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=aimetaverse_beta
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

## Usage

### Starting the System

Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Submitting Tasks

Submit a task using a JSON file:
```bash
python main.py --task tasks/example_task.json
```

Example task JSON:
```json
{
  "type": "full_pipeline",
  "requirements": {
    "programming_language": "python",
    "project_type": "web_application"
  }
}
```

### Checking Task Status

Check the status of a specific task:
```bash
python main.py --status task_123456
```

### System Status

Get overall system status:
```bash
python main.py --system-status
```

## Task Types

The system supports the following task types:

1. **code_generation**: Generate new code structures (Earth)
2. **syntax_check**: Check and fix syntax errors (Moon)
3. **performance_optimization**: Optimize code performance (Sun)
4. **full_pipeline**: Run through all assistants sequentially

## Assistant Capabilities

### Earth Assistant
- Generates foundational code structures
- Uses templates and patterns for different project types
- Supports multiple programming languages

### Moon Assistant
- Identifies syntax errors and potential issues
- Suggests corrections and improvements
- Validates code against language rules

### Sun Assistant
- Analyzes code performance
- Identifies bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Generates optimized code versions

## Development

### Adding New Assistants

1. Create a new assistant class in `assistants/`:
```python
from .base import BaseAssistant

class NewAssistant(BaseAssistant):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__("AssistantName", config)
        
    def process_task(self, task):
        # Implement task processing logic
        pass
```

2. Update `config.py` with assistant configuration
3. Register the assistant in `orchestrator.py`

### Creating Custom Tasks

Create a JSON file with task specifications:
```json
{
  "type": "custom_task",
  "requirements": {
    "custom_field": "value"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "param1": "value1"
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Logging

- Logs are stored in `logs/ai_metaverse.log`
- System status can be monitored using the `--system-status` flag
- Individual task progress can be tracked using task IDs

## Security

- AWS credentials are managed through environment variables
- Task execution is isolated and monitored
- Access control is implemented for all assistants
